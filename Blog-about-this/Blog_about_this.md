<h1> Rails with JavaScript Portfolio Project</h1>

<h2>What were the requirements?</h2>

For this project I needed to refactor my Rails project to use JavaScript.  In particular, I needed to meet the following five requirements.

1. Must render at least one index page via JavaScript and an Active Model Serialization JSON Backend.

2. Must render at least one show page via JavaScript and an Active Model Serialization JSON Backend.

3. Your Rails application must dynamically render on the page at least one 'has-many' relationship through JSON using JavaScript.

4. Must use your Rails application and JavaScript to render a form for creating a resource that submits dynamically.

5. Must translate the JSON responses into JavaScript Model Objects using either ES6 class or constructor syntax. The Model Objects must have at least one method on the prototype.
